open-source-etiquette
=====================

A README with rules to live by in the open source world.

##Maxims

* "Be your own worst critic" - I can't count how many ideas I've had that initially seemed so grand and glorious.  Only later after receiving much criticism from others did I realize that I was wrapped up in my own false glory.
* "Embrace ignorance" - In society, we generally try to avoid looking dumb.  In IT it's even worse.  Academia can compound this to unbelievable heights.  I've learned more from others than I ever could on my own.  That only comes if we're willing to accept that we don't always have the answer.
