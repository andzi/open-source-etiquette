open-source-etiquette
=====================

A README with rules to live by in the open source world.

##Maxims

* "Be your own worst critic" - I can't count how many ideas I've had that initially seemed so grand and glorious.  Only later after receiving much criticism from others did I realize that I was wrapped up in my own false glory.
* "Embrace ignorance" - In society, we generally try to avoid looking dumb.  In IT it's even worse.  Academia can compound this to unbelievable heights.  I've learned more from others than I ever could on my own.  That only comes if we're willing to accept that we don't always have the answer.
* "Embrace failure" - http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/thomasjwa209877.html


##Publishing Work
* The best outcome in any endeaver is one where we've learned a TON!  Don't care so much about having others use what you build.  In the end, people want what's useful.  Rarely do we write something that meets every need.
* Small works are easier to swallow, much like food.
